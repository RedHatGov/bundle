# If you want to override the ImageSetConfiguration generation with a custom change to the API, you might want to use something like this:
#
# imageset_config_override: |-
#   apiVersion: mirror.openshift.io/v1alpha2
#   kind: ImageSetConfiguration
#   ocp:
#     channels:
#       - name: stable-4.9
#         minVersion: 4.9.10
#         maxVersion: 4.9.17
